# About the Project
Pet adoption is a wonderful and rewarding act that is essential to saving the lives of animals in the U.S. At perfect-pet, we want to help match potential adopters with their ideal furry friend as quickly and easily as possible--After all, when an animal finds its fur-ever home, it opens up a space that allows another animal to be rescued. 

While most animal-rescue organizations have websites where potential adopters can search available animals, we noticed that often the search filters are limited and it's still necessary for users to manually look through pages and pages of animals in order to find their perfect match. This can result in would-be adopters becoming discouraged or putting off their search until they have more time to do the in-depth research required to sort through the many available animals. The perfect-pet app provides a range of additional filters that allow for very specific searches, with the goal of reducing the time between a user deciding they want to adopt an animal and their finding a pet that ticks all the right boxes. 

Currently, the app pulls data for all rescue organizations that use the rescuegroups.org API; the goal is to allow users to target specific zip codes or rescues in their vicinity.
